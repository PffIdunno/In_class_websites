        <h2>History of VCS</h2><br>
        <hr style="height: 2px; color: gray;"><br>
        <p>The evolution of VCS spans several decades, with distinct generations of tools marking key milestones. 
            Early systems were centralized, relying on a single repository server, while later systems introduced distributed collaboration</p><br>
        <hr style="height: 2px; color: gray;"><br>
        <h3>A short overview of the VCS timeline:</h3><br>
        <ul>
            <li><b><i>1972: Source Code Control System (SCCS)</i></b> - Developed at Bell Labs, introduced basic change tracking on IBM mainframes.</li>
            <li><b><i>1982: Revision Control System (RCS)</b></i> - Automated change tracking for individual files using delta storage; local VCS without network support.</li>
            <li><b><i>1986: Concurrent Versions System (CVS)</i></b> - Added networked repositories and multi-developer collaboration; widely used in the 1990s despite limitations.</li>
            <li><b><i>2000: Subversion (SVN)</i></b> - Improved on CVS with atomic commits, better file handling, and efficient network operations; popular in the mid-2000s.</li>
            <li><b><i>2005: Git and Mercurial</i></b> - Introduced distributed version control systems (DVCS); Git became dominant due to its speed, flexibility, and widespread adoption.</li>
            <li><b><i>2008: GitHub</i></b> - Launched as a web-based collaboration platform for Git, accelerating its adoption with features like pull requests and issue tracking.</li>
            <li><b><i>2010s: Migration to Git</i></b> - Teams and projects moved from older systems (CVS, SVN) to Git, making DVCS the standard for software development.</li>
            <li><b><i>Late 2010s: GitOps and CI/CD</i></b> - GitOps introduced as a DevOps practice, integrating VCS with automated deployment pipelines.</li>
            <li><b><i>2020s: AI and Large-Scale Collaboration</i></b> - AI tools began assisting in code management and review; GitHub reported over 100 million developers using its platform.</li>
        </ul>
