        <h2>Impact of VSC systems</h2><br>
        <hr style="height: 2px; color: gray;"><br>
        <p>Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS), like Git and Mercurial, 
            revolutionized software development by addressing key limitations of centralized systems and introducing new capabilities.</p><br>
        <hr style="height: 2px; color: gray;"><br>
        <p>A list of DVCS features:</p><br>
        <ul>
            <li><b><i>Local Repositories</i></b> Every developer has a full copy of the repository, including its entire history.
 This allows developers to work offline, commit changes locally, and synchronize with others later.
 In centralized systems, network access to the server is required for most operations.</li>
            <li><b><i>Redundancy and Resilience</i></b> Since every clone is a complete backup of the project, DVCS eliminates the single point of failure inherent in centralized systems.
 If the central server is lost, the project can be restored from any developer's local repository.</li>
            <li><b><i>Flexible Collaboration</i></b> DVCS supports multiple collaboration models.
 Developers can push changes to a central repository (e.g., GitHub) or exchange updates directly with peers.
 This peer-to-peer nature enables non-linear workflows and decentralized teamwork.</li>
            <li><b><i>Efficient Branching and Merging</i></b> Branching is lightweight and fast in DVCS, encouraging developers to create experimental branches and work in parallel.
 Merging is a first-class operation, making it easier to integrate changes from multiple contributors.</li>
            <li><b><i>Speed</i></b> Many operations, such as commits, diffs, and logs, are performed locally, making them faster compared to centralized systems that rely on server communication.</li>
            <li><b><i>Scalability</i></b> DVCS can handle large-scale projects with thousands of contributors, as seen in open-source projects like the Linux kernel.
 This scalability was difficult to achieve with centralized systems.</li>
            <li><b><i>Decentralized Authority</i></b> There is no inherent "master" repository in DVCS; every clone can act as a remote for others.
 Teams can designate a central repository by convention, but the tools themselves don't enforce it.</li>
        </ul>
